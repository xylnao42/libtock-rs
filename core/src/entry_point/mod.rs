// _start and rust_start are the first two procedures executed when a Tock
// application starts. _start is invoked directly by the Tock kernel; it
// performs stack setup then calls rust_start. rust_start performs data
// relocation and sets up the heap before calling the rustc-generated main.
// rust_start and _start are tightly coupled.
//
// The memory layout is controlled by the linker script.
//
// When the kernel gives control to us, we get r0-r3 values that is as follows.
//
//     +--------------+ <- (r2) mem.len()
//     | Grant        |
//     +--------------+
//     | Unused       |
//  S  +--------------+ <- (r3) app_heap_break
//  R  | Heap         |         (hardcoded to mem_start + 3072 in
//  A  +--------------|          Processs::create which could be lesser than
//  M  | .bss         |          mem_start + stack + .data + .bss)
//     +--------------|
//     | .data        |

//  F  +--------------+
//  L  | .crt0_header |
//  A  +--------------+ <- (r0) app_start
//  S  | Protected    |
//  H  | Region       |
//     +--------------+
//
// We want to organize the memory as follows.
//
//     +--------------+ <- app_heap_break
//     | Heap         |
//     +--------------| <- heap_start
//     | .bss         |

// app_heap_break and mem_start are given to us by the kernel. The stack size is
// determined using pointer app_start, and is used with mem_start to compute
// stack_start (stacktop). The placement of .data and .bss are given to us by
// the linker script; the heap is located between the end of .bss and
// app_heap_break. This requires that .bss is the last (highest-address) section
// placed by the linker script.
