    /// # Safety
    ///
    /// Yielding in the main function should be safe. Nevertheless, yielding manually is not required as this is already achieved by the `async` runtime.
    ///
    /// When yielding in callbacks, two problems can arise:
    /// - The guarantees of `FnMut` are violated. In this case, make sure your callback has `Fn` behavior.
    /// - Callbacks can get executed in a nested manner and overflow the stack quickly.
    ///
    /// This function is exported as `libtock::syscalls::raw::yieldk`. Do not reference this name directly. Its only purpose is to establish a back-channel from `async-support`, a patched version of `core` to `libtock-rs` via linking. This workaround has been chosen to keep the `core` crate free of dependencies on platform-specific syscall implementations and is expected to get removed as soon as possible.
